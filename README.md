# Belly Button Analysis
___


This project involves building an **interactive dashboard** to explore a unique dataset that catalogs the microbes found in human belly buttons. The goal was to create a user-friendly interface where users can easily analyze and visualize the data, discovering interesting patterns about microbial species present in different individuals. The dataset reveals that while a few microbial species are commonly found in over 70% of people, the rest are much rarer, making this an interesting area to explore.

Using **JavaScript** and **libraries like D3.js and Plotly**, the project includes a web-based application with features such as a dropdown menu to select different test subjects, a **bar chart** displaying the top 10 most common microbes for the selected individual, and a **bubble chart** providing a more detailed view of the microbial population. The bar chart uses sample values as data points and displays OTU (Operational Taxonomic Units) IDs as labels, while the bubble chart visualizes the relationship between different OTUs and their prevalence.

In addition to the visualizations, the project also displays metadata, such as demographic information of the individual, which dynamically updates based on the selected test subject.
